# 📊 Customer Churn EDA Project Using Python
## 🎯 Primary Objective
To analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset using Python and uncover the key drivers behind customer churn. The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual storytelling, and percentage-based interpretation.
## 🧪 Project Overview
This project dives into how different services (Internet, Security, Tech Support, Streaming, Phone) influence churn behavior. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the analysis highlights which customer groups are most likely to churn and why.

The final output includes:

Percentage-based churn breakdowns

Visualized churn patterns across 9+ service categories

Business-ready insights

High-impact recommendations for churn reduction

#Key Analysis Performed
## 1. Data Cleaning

Converted data types

Handled missing values in the dataset

Ensured numeric columns like TotalCharges were properly formatted

Removed irrelevant or inconsistent entries

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted detailed churn analysis across:

PhoneService & MultipleLines

InternetService (DSL, Fiber Optic, No Internet)

OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection

TechSupport

StreamingTV & StreamingMovies

Each analysis includes both countplots and percentage-based churn tables.

## 3. Percentage Churn Analysis

Calculated churn % for each category. Key findings include:

Fiber Optic churn: 41.89%

No OnlineSecurity churn: 33.78%

No TechSupport churn: 34.04%

DSL churn: 18.96%

No Internet Service churn: 7.40%

## 4. Business Insights

Converted raw visuals into strategic insights highlighting:

Why Fiber customers churn more

How missing security/support services double churn

Why streaming services do not improve retention

Which customer persona has the highest churn probability
